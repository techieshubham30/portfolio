            We as a human, always feel that our mind controls our thoughts and action. It is true, the human mind has the power to create and destroy. It is our thought process that helps us in channelizing our potential for our betterment. Any kind of toxicity leads our action to something which is destructible. Our mind works 24*7, even while sleeping. The two halves of our brain control the entire system of our body. 
Our actions define our behavior in society and our mind control our actions. Everyday chaos impacts the state of our minds. To maintain a certain level of positivity and a good approach towards life, we exercise certain habits to keep our minds healthy. Our mind has its levels of consciousness, unconscious, and subconscious. As an individual, our mind is preoccupied with positive, negative and neutral thoughts.
But as the individual mind is polished and trained over some time in the art of mindfulness.
Mental pressure is always due to our actions which are led by our thought processes. If we follow the principles of mindfulness, where our actions are defined by our positive thought processing mind, we can live a stress-free life. 
Stress in terms of mechanics is defined as the internal forces experienced on the neighboring particles. In the same manner, this stress is developed in mind also, we experience the adverse effect of this force as headache in some extreme cases leading to severe health issues. 
Mental stress can lead to severe conditions, these conditions can be sometimes so serious that a person can lose life also. Emotional trauma or instability is the feeling of numerous emotions which create a sense of insecurity. Stress can be caused by several reasons. It can be personal or professional or something sudden like shifting to a new town can stress you regarding coming across the new environment, new people and new place. Developing an adverse stressful habit can be dangerous for us. Yoga and other mindfulness activity can help in decreasing the adverse effect of mental stress.
